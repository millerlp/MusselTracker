This repository contains hardware designs and software to create a low-cost datalogger that can be used to track mussel behavior and temperature over long periods of time. The basic design includes a thermocouple temperature sensor, a hall effect magnetic sensor to sense valve gape, and a 3-D acclerometer/magnetometer to record mussel shell orientation.

Arduino-style code to run the datalogger is available the MusselTracker2 directory.

Various testing code for individual sensors and the overall circuit board are available in the test_sketches directory. 

Circuit board designs are available in the Eagle_files directory

Orginally a fork of https://github.com/andrewpetersen/MusselTracker/, now with a wholesale rewrite of the software and hardware.
